					<p class="foo">As a kid I've always loved building and making things. There was always something so pleasing about completing something that you spent so much time and effort on, whether with your friends or on your own. My plan wasn't always to be majoring in Computer Science though. While taking a web development class we had just finished our first assignment and that same nostolgic satisfaction I had as a kid came back to me. From there on out I knew Computer Science was what I wanted to do.</p>

					<p>Although I have a concentration in software development at school, I am also working towards minors in Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Information Systems. I have taken classes such as hacking and penetration and will be taking a class in mobile security for my Cybersecurity minor, internetworking and data communications for IT, as well as database management and systems design and analysis for IS. </p>

					<p>I will be graduating form <a href="http://www.marist.edu/compscimath/">Marist College</a> in May of 2017 and I look forward to furthering the knowledge that I have obtained while learning at this institution. </p>
